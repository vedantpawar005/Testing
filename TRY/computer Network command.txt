computer Network command

ipconfig - to check the ip address subnet mask etc
ipconfig/all - to see mac address and everything
help color - to change color
nslookup - find the ip address of domain www.domain.com
eatch direct www.domain.com. 
ping - check how much loss and how many packets recived
tracert <ip address> - it is use to Tracing route to ip (trace)



App - resmon - check port,protocol,etc

* enable * 		: Enters privileged EXEC mode (higher-level access).
configure terminal	: Switches to global configuration mode to configure the router.
IP address ip subnet mask: Assigns an IP address and subnet mask to the router’s interface.
interface path		: Specifies the interface (e.g., FastEthernet0/1) to configure.
hostname name		: Sets the hostname of the router.
no shutdown		: Enables the interface by bringing it up (active).
router RIP/OSPF		: Configures the router to use RIP or OSPF routing protocol.
network path		: Defines the network associated with a routing protocol.
show ip route		: Displays the current routing table.
write			: Saves the running configuration to memory.
copy running-config startup-config: Copies the current configuration to be used after a reboot.
clock rate 6400		: Sets the clock rate for serial interfaces (used in lab environments).
show running-config	: Displays the current configuration in use.
show interfaces		: Shows the status and statistics of all interfaces.
reload			: Reboots the router.
show version		: Displays information about the router’s hardware and software.
debug ip rip		: Shows real-time debugging information about RIP protocol.
no ip domain-lookup	: Disables domain name lookups when typing unrecognized commands.
show ip interface brief	: Displays a summary of the IP address, status, and protocol information for all interfaces.
show version		: Displays system information such as the router’s software version, uptime, hardware details, and more.
show interfaces		: Shows detailed information about all interfaces, including status, IP address, errors, and more.
show running-config	: Displays the current configuration stored in RAM.
show startup-config	: Displays the configuration stored in NVRAM that will be used at next reboot.
show protocols		: Displays the status of all configured Layer 3 protocols.
show ip route		: Displays the current routing table for IP.
show clock		: Displays the router’s current time and date.
show controllers	: Shows detailed hardware information, including controller status for serial interfaces.
show arp		: Displays the router's ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) table, mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses.
show vlan		: Displays VLAN information if VLANs are configured.
show ip nat translations: Displays current Network Address Translation (NAT) translations.





enable -> configure terminal -> Hostname xyz -> Interface port name -> IP address ip default mask -> if(serial port = clock rate 64000) -> no shutdown -> exit -> establish router type (rip,ospf,etc) -> network (ip address of default subnet mask)
